## Union

The **Union** object represents a work group within an organization where a specific set of union rules can be applied. Service Resources are added to a Union through the **Service Resource Union Member** junction object. A set of Union Rules is assigned to the Union. These rules apply when time is logged for the Service Resource.

### Fields

The custom fields in the Union object are listed in the table below:

| Label       | API Name         | Data Type       | Description               | Configuration Options |

A **Union Rule** record contains the configuration for a specific rule and is tied to a parent **Union Rule Set**. The fields on the Union Rule control how the system processes the rule when time is logged for a Service Resource.

## Union Rule Sets

A **Union Rule Set** is a collection of Union Rules that will be assigned to a Union. Once a Union Rule Set is assigned to a Union (and the assignment is within the date criteria), the **Locked** field is automatically set to `true` via a Flow. A locked Union Rule Set cannot be modified â€” Union Rules cannot be added or deleted.

| Label       | API Name         | Data Type       | Description               | Required |
